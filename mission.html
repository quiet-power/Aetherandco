        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
            Aether & Co. exists to serve one purpose: uncover the signal.
            We are not marketers. We are architects of perception. Strategists of resonance.
        </p>
        <p>
            We craft ideas that cut through noise, speak softly, and echo powerfully.
            Our clients are not the loudest. They are the ones ready to say something that matters.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not pitch for work. We present work that speaks for itself.
            Every campaign is built from silence—shaped with care, guided by purpose, and delivered with precision.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not advertising. This is signal design.
